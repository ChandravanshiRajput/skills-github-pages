1. A B 3ft 4ft 5ft C: Yes it is an right triangle.
2. 5yd 8yd 6yd E F & G: No it is not an right triangle.
3. U 7 in V W 11in 9in: No it is not an right triangle.
4. 9ft 12ft 15ft L M N: Yes it is an right triangle.
5. XYZ measure 12ft 16ft and 20ft prove how this is an right triangle: It is because 12 16 and 20 are identified in Pythagoras Theorem Geometry as right triangles and all these 3 numbers equate to 48 which is also an right triangle.
6. Prove that PQR is an right triangle if it measures 15in 20in and 25in: It is because 15 20 and 25 are considered in Geometry as right triangles If u add these numbers up it equates to 60 degrees or inch which is one of 30-60-90 degrees ijn right triangles which these numbers are in right triangles, So yes it is an right triangle.
